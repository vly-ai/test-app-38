Sure, I'll create the new `app/landing.tsx` file for the landing page. The file will include detailed documentation at the top, listing out every part including the purpose, functions, arguments, returns, and a description according to the instructions provided.

```tsx
/**
 * app/landing.tsx
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - This file defines the landing page of the Next.js application.
 * 
 * Functions:
 * - LandingPage: The main React functional component for the landing page.
 * 
 * Arguments:
 * - None
 * 
 * Returns:
 * - JSX.Element: A React element that renders the landing page.
 *  
 * Description:
 * - This is a simple landing page component that welcomes users to the application.
 * - It provides a brief overview and introductory message about the car management system.
 */

"use client";
import React from "react";

/**
 * LandingPage
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - The main React functional component for the landing page.
 * 
 * Arguments:
 * - None
 * 
 * Returns:
 * - JSX.Element: A React element that renders the landing page.
 */
const LandingPage: React.FC = (): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen p-20">
      <div className="flex flex-col mx-auto w-fit items-center">
        <h1>Welcome to the Car Management System!</h1>
        <p>Manage your car details effortlessly with our user-friendly platform.</p>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
};

export default LandingPage;
```

This code defines a new `LandingPage` component which will serve as the entry point. The component currently includes a basic welcome message and a short description, following the required documentary format.
